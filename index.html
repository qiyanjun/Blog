<h2> A little bit background </h2>
<br>
<div>
I grew up in a grass-root family and had no habit of reading (good) books before 2014. My dad only finished third-grade education, and mom stopped her eduction around six grade. During my childhood and teenage time, library and serious books were unfamiliar notations to me. 

Then I became a first-generation college graduate, then finished master and Ph.D. at CMU. During all my formal educational process, I have never grown a good habit of reading, except soap novels for pleasure. Starting from the fall of 2014, a year after I began the faculty job, my journey of reading finally got started. Over the past five years, I have finished around 65 good books, and I took notes here. 

Now reflecting my 2010s,  I realized the best part of my life are these books, besides family and tenure. These books make me happy, thoughtful, feel "rich," and find peace inside.
