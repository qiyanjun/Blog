Book title: Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again 
by Eric Topol  (Author)

   
- [URL](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Medicine-Artificial-Intelligence-Healthcare/dp/1541644638)

- Enlightening, and insightful
- Same author's third book about the future of medicine 

- Author is a world-renowned cardiologist, Executive Vice-President of Scripps Research, founder of a new medical school and one of the top ten most cited medical researchers
- He pointed out the transformational potential of AI for medicine , .is set to save time, lives and money.

- Intro chapter: 
  + Dr. Topol tells us we are living in the Fourth Industrial Age, through AI ; AI has been sneaking into our lives;  
  + The promise is to provide composite views of patients medical data; to improve decision support; to avoid error such as misdiagnosis and unnecesary procedures; to help in the ordering and interpretation of appropriate tests; and to recommend treatments; 
  + For medicine, big datasets take the form of whole-genome sequences, high-res images, and continuous outputs from wearable sensors. 

  + 3D Medicine: digitizing, and democratizing, and deep ;  

  + *Propose three components of deep medicine: (1) deep phenotyping; (2) deep learning based pattern learning; (3) deep empathy and connection between doctors/health systems and patients. *
 
  + current medicine is Shallow medicine, indicating by e.g., physicians spending the majority time looking for information and few minutes talking with patients; doctors are overloaded; current healthcare "is resulting in extraordinary waste, suboptimal outcomes, and unnecessary harm."   

  + Dr. Topol reviews the states of the art: AI is pushing progress in medicine on multiple narrow aspects; He also reviewed the DeepMind controversial beginning push in medicine due to the risk of privacy; 

  + the author tried to connect self-driving cars and medicine in Chapter four; e.g., Five levels of self-driving (from no automation to full automation)

  + chapter6: doctors with patterns, e.g. 1. radiologiests are conducting pattern-centric practices; 2. pattern-heavy elements in other primary care and specialites include such as scans or slides,

  + clinicians without patterns: most physicians, nurses and clinicians do not have pattern-centric practices; their predominant function is making an assessment and formulating a plan. Here the author reviewed the IBM Waston efforts in medicine; reviewed a few potential areas of AI: eye doctor, cancer doctor, heart doctor, surgeon, and other healthcares like neurologists; 

  + Dr. Topol devoted a whole chapter to discuss Mental health and potential of AI for it, especially the "no judgemental" chatbots. 

  + Dr. Topol did a wonderful summary of cutting edge Deep learning efforts in life science and drug discovery

  + Dr. Topol used a whole chapter to survey Diet, nutrition and potential of AI in this important and messy field  

  + AI for clinical output prediction and Virtual medical assitant through better input channels like Alexa...

  + Deep empathy: the last chapter deeplyl discuss the potential of using AI to save time in medicine, which will result in deep bonding between patients and doctors.
