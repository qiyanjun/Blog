 1.	 Sam Altman, President, Y Combinator; Dustin Moskovitz, Cofounder, Facebook, Cofounder, Asana, Cofounder, Good Ventures 
  + Welcome, and Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution Part I 
  + Why to Start a Startup | 
  + "There are much easier ways to become rich and everyone who starts a startup always says, always, that they couldn't have imagined how hard and painful it was going to be. You should only start a startup if you feel compelled by a particular problem and that you think starting a company is the best way to solve it."
  + "Good startups usually take ten years."
  + "The hardest part about coming up with great ideas, is that the best ideas often look terrible at the beginning.  ...That's how most great companies get started. Unpopular but right is what you're going for. You want something that sounds like a bad idea, but is a good idea... Why now? Why is this the perfect time for this particular idea, and to start this particular company. Why couldn't it be done two years ago, and why will two years in the future be too late?"
  + "One of the most important tasks for a founder is to make sure that the company builds a great product. Until you build a great product, nothing else matters. When really successful startup founders tell the story of their early days its almost always sitting in front of the computer working on their product, or talking to their customers. That's pretty much all the time."

 2.	Sam Altman, President, Y Combinator ; Ideas, Products, Teams and Execution Part II 
  + to go on a vacation and that never works for founders. It's sort of all consuming in this way that is very difficult to understand. ... So what you do is you just keep going.
  + " Cofounder relationships are among the most important in the entire company. ..  looking for cofounders that need to be unflappable, tough, they know what to do in every situation. They act quickly, they're decisive, they're creative, they're ready for anything"
  + "how much time you should be spending on hiring. The answer is zero or twenty-five percent. "
  + "There are three things I look for in a hire. Are they smart? Do they get things done? Do I want to spend a lot of time around them?"
  +  "Mediocre founders spend a lot of time talking about grand plans, but they never make a decision. They're talking about you know I could do this thing, or I could do that other thing, and they're going back and forth and they never act. And what you actually need is this bias towards action."
  + " Boards add value to business strategy only rarely. But very frequently you can use them as a forcing function to get the company to care about metrics and milestones."
  
 3.	Paul Graham, Founder, Y Combinator :  Before the Startup 
  + Startups are very counterintuitive and I'm not sure exactly why.  the list of the counterintuitive stuff you have to remember to prevent your existing instincts from leading you astray. startups are so weird that if you follow your instincts they will lead you astray. 
  + First: Work with people you would generally like and respect and that you have known long enough to be sure about 

  + Second: What you need to know to succeed in a startup is not expertise in startups, what you need is expertise in knowing your own users. ... the best way to convince investors is to start a startup that is actually doing well, meaning growing fast, and then simply tell investors so...  the way to make your startup grow is to make something that users really love, and then tell them about it. 

  + Third: counterintuitive thing to remember about startups: starting a startup is where gaming the system stops working. Gaming the system may continue to work, if you go to work for a big company, depending on how broken the company is"

  + "fourth counterintuitive point, startups are all consuming. If you start a startup, it will take over your life to a degree that you cannot imagine and if it succeeds it will take over your life for a long time; for several years, at the very least, maybe a decade, maybe the rest of your working life. So there is a real opportunity cost here. "

  + "the fifth counter intuitive point: You can't tell.  I learned from experience to keep completely open mind about which start ups in each batch would turn out to be the stars. ".. " Instead of trying to make a conscious effort to think of startup ideas, turn your brain into the type that has startup ideas unconsciously. In fact, so unconsciously that you don't even realize at first that they're startup ideas. "

  + " One guaranteed way to turn your mind into the type to start up ideas for them unconsciously. Is to get yourself to the leading edge of some technology. To, as Paul Buchheit put it, "Live in the future." And when you get there, ideas that seem uncannily prescient to other people will seem obvious to you. You may not realize they're start up ideas, but you will know they are something that ought to exist."

  + "but business school was designed to teach people management. Management is a problem that you only have in a startup if you are sufficiently successful. So really what you need to know early on to make a start up successful is developing products. ... Honestly the best way to learn on how to start a startup is just to just try to start it."

 4. Adora Cheung, Founder, Homejoy ; Building Product, Talking to Users, and Growing
  + "what are the things that most people do incorrectly when starting a startup? The novice approach is thinking, "I have this really great idea, I don't want to tell anyone about it. I'm going to build, build, build and then going to maybe tell one or two people and then I'm going to launch it on TechCrunch or somewhere like that, and then I'm going to get lots of users."

  + " You should be able to describe your problem in one sentence. And then you should think, "How does that problem relate to me? Am I really passionate about that problem?" And then you should think, "Okay it's a problem I have, but is it a problem that other people have?" And you verify that by going out and talking to people."

  + "If you are in a situation like mine where there is a service element of it then you should go and do that service yourself."

  + " You should be so obsessed that you want to know what everybody in that space is doing. And it is things like writing a list of all of the potential competitors, similar types of companies, and Google searching them and clicking on every single link and reading every single article from search result number 1 to 1000."

  + "The second thing is identifying customer segments."
  + "And lastly, before you even create a product or before you put code down, you should really storyboard out the user experience of how you are going to solve the problem."
  + "Minimal viable product pretty much means what is the smallest feature set that you should build to solve the problem that you are trying to solve. "

  + "The best way to do that is by tracking customer retention. The number of people that came in the door today, the number of people who are coming back tomorrow, the next day and so forth. "

  + "You need to not try and automate everything and create software to have robots run everything. What you should do to really understand what you should build is manually do it yourself.... "In week one you should basically build as much as possible to get that one user. And then a week to build as much to get two users"

  + "I hate to keep harping on it but these are things that I see today with founders and something that I went through as well. And I think that unless you are building something that requires tens of millions of dollars just to start up there is really no point in waiting around to launch the product."

  + "So there are three types of growth. Sticky, viral, and paid growth. Sticky growth is trying to get your existing users to come back and pay you more or use you more. Viral growth is when people talk about you. So you use a product, you really like it and you tell ten other friends, and they like it. That's viral growth. And the third is paid growth. If you happen to have money in the bank you're going to be able to use part of that money to buy growth."


 5.	Peter Thiel, Founder, Paypal, Founder, Palantir, and Founder, Founders Fund :  Competition is For Losers
  + "today’s speaker is Peter Thiel, Peter was the founder of PayPal, Palantir, and Founders Fund and has invested in most of the tech companies in Silicon Valley. He's going to talk about strategy and competition. "
  + "you always want to aim for monopoly and you want to always avoid competition. And so hence competition is for losers,"
  + "there's basically a very simple formula, that if you have a valuable company two things are true. Number one, that it creates "X" dollars of value for the world. Number two, that you capture "Y" percent of "X.” And the critical thing that I think people always miss in this sort of analysis is that "X" and "Y" are completely independent variables, and so "X" can be very big and "Y" can be very small. "X" can be an intermediate size and if "Y” is reasonably big, you can still have a very big business."
  + "it's generally not that good if you're involved in anything that’s hyper competitive, because you often don't make money. "

  + "I do think the extreme binary view of the world I always articulate is that there are exactly two kinds of businesses in this world, there are businesses that are perfectly competitive and there are businesses that are monopolies. There is shockingly little that is in between. And this dichotomy is not understood very well because people are constantly lying about the nature of the businesses they are in. "

  + " I would say that the that one of the reasons the tech industry in the US has been so successful financially is because it's prone to creating all these monopoly-like businesses.." 

  + " I think one of the sort of very counterintuitive ideas that comes out of this monopoly thread is that you want to go after small markets. "
  + "You want to be a one of a kind company. You want to be the only player in a small ecosystem. "
  + "all happy companies are different because they're doing something very unique. All unhappy companies are alike because they failed to escape the essential sameness in competition."
  + " My sort of crazy, somewhat arbitrary rule of thumb is you want to have a technology that's an order of magnitude better than the next best thing. "
  + "the scientists never make any money. They’re always deluded into thinking that they live in a just universe that will reward them for their work and for their inventions. This is probably the fundamental delusion that scientists tend to suffer from in our society.... We should ask is this a rationalization to obscure the fact that "Y" equals zero percent and the scientists are operating in this sort of world where all the innovation is effectively competed away and they can’t capture any of it directly.... . There is the classic Henry Kissinger line describing his fellow faculty at Harvard, “The battles were so ferocious because the stakes were so small,” describing academia"
  + "There are, in my mind, probably only two broad categories in the entire history of the last two hundred and fifty years where people actually came up with new things and made money doing so. One is these sort of vertically integrated complex monopolies which people did build in the second industrial revolution at the end of the nineteenth and start of the twentieth century. This is like Ford, it was the vertically integrated oil companies like Standard Oil, and what these vertically integrated monopolies typically required was a very complex coordination, you've got a lot of pieces to fit together in just the right way, and when you assemble that you had a tremendous advantage. This is actually done surprisingly little today and so I think this is sort of a business form that when people can pull it off, is very valuable."
  + " But so much of people's identities got wrapped up in winning these competitions that they somehow lost sight of what was important, what was valuable....  this tremendous price that you stop asking some bigger questions about what's truly important and truly valuable. Don't always go through the tiny little door that everyone's trying to rush through, maybe go around the corner and go through the vast gate that nobody is taking."
