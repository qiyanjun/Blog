- I like its last part :  Learn to Analyze Your Data and Communicate your Findings

1. study quantitative data analysis, interpreting your findings through simple statistical calculations that describe your data in useful ways. 
2. how inferential statistics allow you to draw conclusions from your data, and to compare groups using statistical means. 
3.  vital methods such as how to track the correlation or relationship between your data variables, and how to assess causation between your variables. 
4. qualitative data analysis, which involves discerning meaning and patterns in data, and the principle approaches to qualitative analysis you may need for your research.
