  + summary from [url](http://www.wikisummaries.org/wiki/Good_to_Great:_Why_Some_Companies_Make_the_Leap..._and_Others_Don%27t): 
  > "First and foremost, Collins contends that companies need a set of core values in order to achieve the kind of long-term, sustainable success that may lead to greatness. Companies need to exist for a higher purpose than mere profit generation in order to transcend the category of merely good. According to Collins, this purpose does not have to be specific -- even if the shared values that compel the company toward success are as open-ended as being the best at what they do and achieving excellence consistently, that may be sufficient as long as the team members are equally dedicated to the same set of values."
