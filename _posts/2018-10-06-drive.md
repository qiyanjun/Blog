Book title: Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us

- [URL](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers)

- A good summary https://fastertomaster.com/a-mind-for-numbers-barbara-oakley/ 

- Some interesting text from the book: 
  + three types of motivations: (1) biological drive (2) reward-and-punishment drive, (3) third drive:  deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilities, and to live a life of purpose.
  + to motivate the third drive, we need: (1) Autonomy—the desire to direct our own lives; (2) Mastery—the urge to get better and better at something that matters; and (3) Purpose—the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.
  + Tasks are either: (1) Algorithmic— mostly do the same thing over and over in a certain way, or (2) Heuristic— need to come up with something new every time because there are no set instructions to follow. 
  + Heuristic type of jobs are more prevalent and need more from the 3rd type of motivation.
