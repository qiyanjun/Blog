11.	Patrick Collison, Co-Founder, Stripe;  John Collison, Co-Founder, Stripe ; Ben Silbermann, Founder & CEO, Pinterest 
   + Hiring and Culture, Part II
  + [transcripts](https://genius.com/Patrick-collison-lecture-11-company-culture-and-building-a-team-part-ii-annotated)
  +  Ben Silbermann, the founder of Pinterest, and John and Patrick Collison, the founders of Stripe. Founders that have obviously, some of the best thinking about culture and building their teams.
  + Ben Silbermann: What are the most important parts? For us, we think on a few dimensions. One is who we hire, what those people value. Two is what we do every day. Why do we do it? Three is what we choose to communicate and I think four is how we choose to celebrate. Then the converse of this is what you choose to punish, but in general I think running a company based on what we celebrate is more exciting than what we punish. I think, the four things I think make up the bulk of it for us.
  + John Collison: One thing, I think Stripe has placed a large emphasis on, more so than other companies, is transparency internally. So as we have grown, we started off two people, we’re now a hundred seventy people, we’ve put a lot of thought into the tooling that goes around, transparency.
  + " culture is the invariant that you want to maintain, as you get specifically involved in fewer and fewer decisions over time. When you think about it that way, maybe intended importance becomes self-evident. Again, the fraction of things you can be involved in directly, diminishing, exponentially, assuming your headcount growth is on a curve that looks like one of the great companies. "
  + " For example, in hiring, maybe the reason the first ten people you hire, the decisions are so important that aren't just hiring those first ten people, you are actually hiring a hundred people because you think each one of those people are going to bring along another ten people with them. "
  + "I have read all these books on culture,... so I think one big misconception that someone said once was, people think of culture as architecture when it is a lot more like gardening. "
  +  "I often looked for three to four things that I really valued in people. I looked for people who worked hard, had high integrity, low ego. I looked for people who were creative, super curious, which meant they had all these interests.... we find, the people that are excited about many disciplines and extraordinary at once, tend to build really great products and are really great at collaborating.... e really want someone who wants to build something great. And they aren't arrogant about it, they want to take a risk and build something bigger than themselves."
  + Three traits we came up with, genuine, caring a great deal, and completing things.
    - "At least for us, it was over a very long time period talking to people we knew ... For our first ten people, the things that seemed to be important, they were also very genuine and straight.... There are a lot of people who are really excited about tons of things. Only some of those are excited about completing things.... I think it's much more interesting to work with someone who took two years to spend time going deeper into an area. And then the third trait that we looked for is that they cared a great deal, it's offensive to them when something is just a little off. "
    - "Everyone was always like, it was borderline insane how much they cared about tiny details like we used to. Every single API request that ever generated an error went to all of our inboxes and phoned all of us. Because it seemed terrible to get an error that didn't get a resolution from the users standpoint. Or we used to copy everyone else on outgoing email and point out slight grammar or spelling mistakes to each other. Because it would be horrible to ever send an email with a spelling mistake. "
    - "I think the really good people, generally are doing something else so you have to go seek them out instead of expecting that they are going to seek you out."
  + Ben Silbermann: You will never 100% know until you work with folks. So the flip side is, if the person you hired is not a good fit, you owe it to them and to the company to tell them where to improve and if they aren't working out, then to fire them. 
    - Before we talk to anyone, we try to figure out what exactly is world class in that discipline need. 
    - So I always made it a habit of mine to talk to people I knew de facto were world class and just asking them, what are the traits you look for? What are the questions you ask? And how to find them? If you are looking for the next person that is as good as you, where is that person working right now and what's her phone number? I think that learning what's good and bad during the interview process is extremely expensive. It is an expensive use of your time, expensive use of everyone else's time. A recalibration of that really matters.
    - Really great people want to do things that are going to be hard. They want to solve tough problems,...  you lay out in gory detail why it's going to be hard. And then the right people select in or they select out of that opportunity.
  + Patrick Collison: I think a specific tactical thing to do, again, for the first ten people is to work with them as much as you can before committing to hire them.
  + Ben Silbermann: I think referencing people is really important Referencing people is just what it sounds like. Asking people with experience for their honest opinion. We do that really aggressively but we are trying to figure out what this person is like to work with. ... To evaluate this person's dimensions, is this person the top 1% of the people you worked with, the top 5%, and the top 10%? And it forces scarcity that gives them material reference.
    - Now as the company grows, I think that problem has to get a little more formalized. So we spend a lot of time thinking and constantly trying to refine what that person looked like from the day they came in, to their first interview, through 30 days after they joined.
    - Then we also ask their peers and manager, hey is this person up to speed? Do you feel we did a good job at making them productive? If we haven't then thats a key that a) we should not be hiring any more people because we're not doing a good job bringing in new people and b) we need to retool that.
    -  I think one thing we try to do on the team side is to make the teams feel as autonomous and nimble as possible within the constraints of the organization. That means over time we are trying to make it feel like a startup of many startups.
  + John Collison: And so when we have engineers start, we try to get them committing on the first day. When we have people in business roles start, we will have them in real meetings the first day on what they are meant to be working on. Sometimes it's easy to be tentative and ease people in. We are much more, push people off the cliff. Then second, we try to quickly give people feedback. Expectedly giving people feedback on how to adapt to the culture. 
    - So one of the lucky and in hindsight decisions we made was our actual fourteenth or fifteenth person we hired was a professional recruiter. She worked at startups, she worked at big companies like Apple. But she sort of knew where that pipeline breaks down. Knew the early indicators, and taught everyone not just how to screen for talent but to identify the people who are going to be culturally really good for the company. 
  + Patrick Collison: Startups, ... is an organization that is not yet stuck with all these principal agent problems.  But because everyone is rolling in the same direction, a startup, you can kind of make all the information transparent. Like I said earlier, Stripe used to bcc us to be on every email unless you opted out of it. 
  + Ben Silbermann: I think for us the answer is some yes and some no. I think one of the benefits of working at a startup is you can be handed a challenge no one else would be crazy enough to let you take on. 
  + Patrick Collison: I think the other thing that motivates people a great deal is the prospect of affecting some outcome, is just the personal development angle. 

12.	Aaron Levie, Founder, Box : Building for the Enterprise
  + [transcripts](https://genius.com/Aaron-levie-lecture-12-sales-and-marketing-annotated)
  + "The first is the quick background of Box. Because when we first started out, we did not know we wanted to do enterprise software. ".
    - " We launched the company in 2005, we got the idea back in college which was 2004. "
    - " what we noticed in 2004, in college, was for some reason it was really hard to share files. And as simple of an idea as that is now, and you go back ten years. It was either really expensive or really hard to move data around through corporate companies. " 
    - " The first point to remember, always look for the changing technology factors.... there were a lot of factors that changed in the software world. The first was the cost of storage was dropping dramatically. "
    - " So we had more than what a consumer needed and not enough that an enterprise needed. So we found ourselves at the juncture. "
    - " Okay consumer looks really fun, enterprise looks really hard and there is a lot of competition. At the same time, in this consumer space you are always fighting this issue of how do you monetize? How do you actually get people to pay for product? In the consumer space there are really only two business models that you can do. You can either have people pay for your application or you could provide advertising on the application... We are going to be fighting to get consumers to pay a few dollars a month.  "
    - " We were really fortunate. We had an investor, early in his career, make a belief on us because there was something changing with the enterprise that we would be able to take advantage of. "
    - "we architected the business model, we architected the software, we architected the solution to work in one specific version of the world, and it turned out that one solution was the one that happened... . The first is that most application companies are moving to the cloud. "
    - "The platforms themselves are becoming more global. Our customers were internationally a couple weeks after starting the company."
  + "Then we are going to talk the major factors that changed in enterprise software that make it possible to do a startup today."
    - "There are only two times, two moments of opportunity where a technology revolution will happen in an enterprise. The first is where raw materials change. So cost of computing goes down and they centralize and let people use it on demand. The second thing that can change, is the very people that these enterprises have to go after need new experiences at that enterprises product."
    - "No one is prepared, what does it mean when consumers want to go buy goods anytime from anywhere with better information, better intelligence. So every retailer in the world is going to need a new technology stack to power their retail experiences."
  + " And finally we are going to look at patterns that are ways to recognize and go build a startup by yourself."
    - "So the first one is to spot technology disruptions. .. You have to look for new enabling technologies, or major trends, like fundamental trends, that create a wide gap between how things are done and how they can be done. ... something that was impossible 5, 10 years ago is now very practical. "
    - "The next thing is, in enterprise, you want to start intentionally small."
    - "Then next you really want to find asymmetries. You want to do things that incumbents can't or won't do because either the economics don't make sense for them, the economics are so unusual, or because technically they can't...e.g, thus created a business model that no other software company has been able to think of or attack. "
    - "The next is you want to find the mostly crazy, but still reasonable outliers within the customer ecosystem.....Paul Graham has a great article where he talks about living in the future and building what is missing when you are living in the future.... work with a lot of those early adopters to establish their platform.  "
    - "Listen to your customers but don't always build exactly what they are telling you. This is a really key distinction around building enterprise software. .. It is your job to listen to their problems, and translate those into what is going to build the best and simplest solution for them. "
    - "You want to modularize not customize. So build a platform as opposed to building all the custom technology and customer vertical experiences into the software itself. Make sure you really think about openness and APIs as a way of building experiences. "
    - "read these three books: Crossing the Chasm, the Innovators Dilemma, and Behind the Cloud. These three combined, if you binge and read them all, you will come out ahead."


13.	Reid Hoffman, Partner, Greylock Ventures and Founder, LinkedIn :  How To Be A Great Founder
  + [transcripts](https://genius.com/Reid-hoffman-lecture-13-how-to-be-a-great-founder-annotated)
  + "how is one a great founder, these are all skills that are super important. "
  + "1. Founder team.... To explode the myth of super founder is usually it's best to have two or three people on a team rather than a solo founder..... Well the reason is, because of what great founders do is seek the networks that will be essential to their task. And they realize it's not just about, I am superman, I can do this anywhere. I can do this in Antarctica, etc, in order to be successful, I have to go to where the strongest networks are for the particular kind of thing that I am doing. And Silicon Valley, by the way, is super good at some kind of tasks, some places that you essentially try to solve certain types of problems. But it's not good at all of them. "
