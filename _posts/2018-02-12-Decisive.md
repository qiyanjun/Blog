- A few practical recommendations for rational thinking: 

1. Widen your options
- never only just two choices 
- think about opportunity costs, or creative ways to get everything. 
- Find someone who has solved the same problem in the same or different domain.

2. Reality-test your assumptions. 
- What would it take for your assumptions to be wrong? 
- Can you test your assumptions?

3. Attain distance before deciding. 
- Get away from short-term emtions. 
- Define your core priorities.

4. Prepare to be wrong. 
- Define acceptable operating boundaries. 
- Define milestones that are acceptable operating boundaries. 
- Set tripwires where you will check along the way.
