1. Performance drives success, but when performance can’t be measured, networks drive success. 
	- "It’s not what you know, it’s WHO you know. Or rather, who knows YOU. 
	- You can create something great, but it helps if people who are already known for being great know just how great YOU are.""

2. Performance is bounded, but success is unbounded. 
	- "There’s only so fast you can run, or how good you can make your product."" 
	- "But there’s no limit to how much money you can make, or how many lives you can influence.""

3. Previous success x fitness = future success. 
	- "It helps if you’re already known for being awesome, and then it helps to actually BE awesome. ""
	- If you’re not known yet, connect with someone who is. People listen to those they know, even when it doesn’t make sense to do so.

4. While team success requires diversity and balance, a single individual will receive credit for the group’s achievements. 
	- "in sports all the time. It’s the exact opposite of group projects from school (where one individual does all the work, and the group receives credit for the assignment)."

5. With persistence success can come at any time. 
	- "It’s never too late. You never know which of your efforts will lead to a sudden breakthrough, so keep going. Keep creating. "
	- the reason behind old saying "after certain age, no breakthrough" is because people try less when aging.
