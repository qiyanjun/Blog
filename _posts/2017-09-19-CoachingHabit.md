* Seven essential questions: / less advises / more curiosity / ask one question at a time / get comfortable with silence for 3 seconds

1. Q1. What's on your mind? / coaching for performance: / coaching for development: rare, more powerful / silence is ok / 3P model: Project: People: Pattern
2. Q2. And what else? (3 to 5 times)
3. Q3.  What is the real question or challenge here for you:/ focus question/ stop yourself to jumping to providing solutions, slow down to get the real problem /coaching is about the mentored, not other things
4. Q4. What do you want? Really want? / Foundation question / the fundamental functions of brain: 5 times a second to scan situations as environmental safe or not  / clear expectations? High Rank speaker ? Autonomy, some self choices?
5. Q5:  how can I help? / do not be a rescuer / overuse term: strategic plans only on top shelf/ be very clear what to fully committed to / yes is nothing without a clear definition of no /==> use 3P models to choose necessary NO:  what projects to avoid / what people you do not need to manage / what patterns to avoid/ say YES MORE slowly after better understanding
6. Q6: Stay curious and ask: ==> planning: 1. What is our winning aspirations?; 2. What and where impact? Where do we play?  3. How will we win? 4. What capabilities need to have? How to become and stay as strength : 5. What to measure? What management design? ==> strategic question: / say YES to work meaningful for you and important/
7. Q7:  what was the most useful to you? / what did you learn? / ==> the learning question: people only learn when in double-loop, in the second loop reflecting the thing in the first loop. This is because Brain has very low retention rate in learning/ neural model: AGES MODEL for longer term memory: attention, generation, emotion, and spacing! / use Generation strategy here: ask the mentored to generate questions from yours, to interrupt forgetting/


*  Formula How to trigger New habits:
1. short and specific cue->ask questions in all possible channels, e.g. Ask talks or meetings  (a strong and positive way to finish a conversation) /
2. rewards->clear of the payoff  /
3. micro-habit that can finish in less than five seconds to do- / when habit breaks down- be resilient and return / nothing stronger than habits
4. Five types of triggers: time, location, people, actions / starts from easy, small / Coaching,  weekly checking, 3/months checking,

* The end : author recommends a list of great books ****
