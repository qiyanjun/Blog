- A good book summary here [URL](https://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/book-summaries/self-help/atomic-habits/)

- Main ideas 
	+ Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
	+ If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.
	+ The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.
	+ The Four Laws of Behavior Change are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits. They are (1) make it obvious, (2) make it attractive, (3) make it easy, and (4) make it satisfying.
	+ Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.             


- Ch1: Tiny Habits: 
	+ “You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results.”
	“The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. "

- Chapter 4: The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
	+ “If you’re having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, ask yourself: ‘Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?’”                “With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.” “Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.” 
	+ “The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.”


- Chapter 5: The Best Way to Start a New Habit
	+ “Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.”
	+ “One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.”
