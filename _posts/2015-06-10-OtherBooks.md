- [URL](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N8R5QD7/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

Five things To build resilience when facing Adversity:

1. Personalization, Pervasiveness, Permanence

From the  book: “We plant seeds of resilience in the ways we process negative events. After spending decades studying how people deal with setbacks, psychologist Martin Seligman found that three P’s can stunt recovery: (1) personalization-the belief that we are at fault; (2) pervasiveness-the belief that an event will affect all areas of our life; and (3) permanence-the belief that the aftershocks of the event will last forever,”

2. Kick The Elephant Out Of The Room

 Sandberg and Grant write there is a lot of evidence that speaking about traumatic events improves mental and physical health, helps people understand their own emotions and feel understood by others.

3. Self-Confidence & Self-Compassion  
From the bottom by ok:, “ I didn’t have to aim for perfection. I didn’t have to believe in myself all the time. I just had to believe I could contribute a little bit more…Over the years, this lesson has stuck with me whenever I feel overwhelmed.“

4. Contribute
+ suggested to write down three things did well every day.

"gratitude is passive: it makes us feel thankful for what we receive. Contributions are active: they build our confidence by reminding us that we can make a difference"

5. Pay Attention To Joy
. “Rather than waiting until we’re happy to enjoy the small things, we should go and do the small things that make us happy. ” When you seize more and more moments of happiness, you find that they give you strength.

6. The rest of the book is about how to raise strong children, and create resilient families, communities, and workplaces.
