- A must read and an eye-opener.
- Being an introverted person, this book helps me understand many social phenomenas that have puzzled me for years!


- Interesting concepts to take away:

+ Be true to yourself, and try to get into situations that play well with your personality, rather than forcing uncomfortable situations.
+ A list positive characteristics are attributed to introverts, such as creativity, and whether that is a true reflection.

+ The author's views that introverts are highly undervalued, particularly in leadership positions.

+ The first part of the book “The Extrovert Ideal,” discussed the historical creation of the “Culture of Personality”.

+ The second part of the book “Your Biology, Your Self?” used scientific evidence to explain a so-called “rubber band theory” of personality, meaning that we are elastic and can stretch ourselves beyond our innate traits, but only within certain limits.

+ The third part “Do All Cultures Have an Extrovert Ideal?” stated that many cultures do not emphasize traits, such as class participation, as a measure of success.

+ The fourth Part “How to Love, How to Work,” discussed the potential difficulties in communication between introverts and extroverts,  how to foster traits such as depth and sensitivity, rather than trying to force introverted children to be extraverted.
